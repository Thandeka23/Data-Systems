Project Overview

This project provides an in-depth analysis of various data systems, their architectures, strengths, and practical Python implementations. It explores relational and NoSQL databases, distributed file systems, cloud-based data storage solutions, and in-memory systems, demonstrating their integration with Python.

Task Requirements

1. Relational Databases

Understand the structure and query mechanisms using SQL.

Python integration using libraries such as sqlite3 and SQLAlchemy.

Best-use scenarios for relational databases.

2. NoSQL Databases

Cover different types: key-value stores, document stores, and column-family stores.

Python integration using libraries such as PyMongo (MongoDB) and Cassandra.

3. Distributed File Systems

Explore data storage solutions like Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).

Python interaction using tools like PyArrow and hdfs package.

4. Cloud-Based Data Systems

Investigate cloud-based storage and processing solutions like Amazon S3 and Google BigQuery.

Python SDKs such as boto3 (AWS) and google-cloud-bigquery (GCP) for interaction.

5. In-Memory Data Systems

Discuss solutions like Redis and Memcached for high-speed data access.

Python libraries such as redis-py and pymemcache for interfacing.

Research Questions Addressed

Architecture and Design

Describe the structure and functionality of each data system.

Strengths and Limitations

Compare each systemâ€™s advantages and drawbacks.

Python Implementation

Provide practical Python examples demonstrating interaction with each data system.

Use Cases and Scenarios

Justify the selection of a particular data system based on real-world applications.
